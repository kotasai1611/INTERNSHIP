# End-to-End AI-Driven Recruitment Pipeline

## Real-Time Interview Insights & Cultural Fit Scoring

### Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the hiring process with an advanced AI-powered recruitment pipeline. By utilizing machine learning and data analytics, the system provides dynamic interview insights and cultural fit scores, ensuring more informed and effective hiring decisions.

The solution is divided into five key stages:

1. *Data Generation:* Automatically creates synthetic datasets tailored to recruitment scenarios.
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* Analyzes and visualizes datasets to extract valuable insights.
3. *Training:* Builds and trains machine learning models for candidate evaluation.
4. *Screening:* Uses trained models to filter candidates based on predefined criteria.
5. *Prediction:* Generates real-time predictions and scores during interviews to aid in hiring decisions.

### Key Features

- *Synthetic Data Generation:* Creates realistic datasets for model training and testing in recruitment.
- *In-depth EDA:* Delivers powerful visualizations to discover data patterns and trends.
- *Machine Learning Model Training:* Utilizes state-of-the-art algorithms for assessing candidates.
- *Real-Time Interview Insights:* Provides immediate insights during interviews for quick decision-making.
- *Cultural Fit Scoring:* Focuses not just on skills, but also evaluates candidates' fit within the company culture.
- *AI-Powered Screening:* Uses NLP and machine learning to assess resumes, transcripts, and other applicant data to match candidates with the job requirements.
- *Predictive Analytics:* Employs various classification models to forecast candidate success and enhance decision-making.
- *Role-Specific Analysis:* Generates personalized insights and recommendations for different roles, ensuring fairness and efficiency in the process.
